ssdk - the small ooc sdk

Most of it comes from the standard rock sdk, so this is released under the same license.  The goal is to have an sdk that implements the C standard library and a few expected ooc-isms (ArrayList, HashMap, and String), all of which must work without a garbage collector and coexist with it. (Garbage Collection is not evil, it's just nice to know that you don't need it)
